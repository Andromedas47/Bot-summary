/**
 * HISTORICAL_PRODUCTION_BASELINE = the migrations recorded in Production's
 * supabase_migrations.schema_migrations ledger. These are immutable: Production
 * has already run them, so their filenames and SQL must never change and their
 * versions must never be reused.
 *
 * PENDING_FORWARD_MIGRATIONS = migrations that exist in the repository but have
 * not been applied to Production yet. They are legitimate, not drift — but they
 * must sort strictly after PRODUCTION_LEDGER_MAX_VERSION so they can never
 * collide with, or silently sort before, an already-applied migration.
 *
 * The forward cutoff is the PRODUCTION LEDGER max, NOT the largest historical
 * repository filename. The two are not the same number: Production applied
 * 20260829090000_produce_pending_inactivity_lifecycle.sql under ledger version
 * 20260831045503 (see production_ledger_drift). A file such as
 * 20260830090000_x.sql sorts after the filename baseline but BEFORE the real
 * ledger max, so it would be ordered behind a migration Production has already
 * run. Only the ledger max is a safe forward boundary.
