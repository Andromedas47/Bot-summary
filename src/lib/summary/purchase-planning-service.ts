/**
 * The one and only way to produce a PurchasePlanningReport from the database.
 *
 * Read-only. Writes nothing, seeds no price, and adds no table of its own —
 * every source below already exists and is reused rather than reinterpreted:
 *
 *   fetchSalesProduceRows        persisted, void-filtered produce_transactions.
 *                                Deliberately applies NO server-side
 *                                transaction_type filter, because the legacy
 *                                "เสีย" spelling is not normalized by the view
 *                                and filtering it away would understate returns
 *                                and overstate what sold.
 *   loadRoundReturnStatuses      per-round return evidence (persisted / blocked
 *                                / pending / none).
 *   loadProduceFailureScan       produce documents that never landed, plus the
 *                                rounds whose return attempt is still failing.
 *   fetchAuthoritativeHouseStockItems
 *                                the single authoritative P2A house snapshot.
 *
 * House stock is loaded through the SAME authoritative selection the formatted
 * 🏠 report uses, so the two can never disagree about which snapshot counts.
